## Start a RCP runtime from sources
The RCP product can be started in a development environment using the checked out source. They have to be imported into an eclipse IDE and can then be run by starting a correct launch config. Such a config can be generated by performing the following steps:

 - Open the `de.persosim.rcp.product` file in the project of same name in the Product Configuration Editor
 - Click the `Launch an eclipse Application` link in the `Testing`-Section on the `Overview`-Tab

The generated config has the name `de.persosim.rcp.product`.
 
## Build a PersoSim product release
The release artifacts are created using a Maven 3 build. To create the product for all supported platforms run `mvn clean verify` in the `de.persosim.rcp.releng` folder. The products can then, after a successful build, be found in the `de.persosim.rcp.product/target/products` folder.
